# Welcome to the Marek Project Archive 🚀

This site documents a collection of projects spanning multiple years. Each project represents an exploration into electronics, embedded systems, and creative engineering solutions. The archive is organized by year, making it easy to follow the progression of ideas, designs, and technical experiments.

## 📂 Project Collections

- **[Projects 2022](../Projects2022/)**  
  The foundation year, featuring simple but essential designs such as display drivers and early prototypes.

- **[Projects 2023](../Projects2023/)**  
  A year of refinement and ergonomics, with projects focused on usability and efficiency, like the ErgoSplit40 keyboard.

- **[Projects 2024](../Projects2024/)**  
  A technically rich year, diving into data acquisition and advanced component-level design such as analog-to-digital converters and specialized IC experiments.

- **[Projects 2025](../Projects2025/)**  
  The latest collection of innovative builds, covering topics from battery management and LED controllers. 

- **[Projects 2026](../Projects2026/)**  
  Finaliesed the Battey charger project, further developement with the cosmol keyboard and HF technooloies. 

## 🎯 Purpose

This archive is meant to:

- Serve as a **knowledge base** for future reference.
